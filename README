This is a collection of programs that originally accumulated within my
"lastfmsubmitd" package. They gather data from MusicBrainz and use it to
rip CDs and/or submit to Last.fm.

Querying
========

mbget will read the CD in your computer's CD-ROM drive, query
MusicBrainz for its album information, and output it in YAML. This
format is like the one lastfmsubmitd uses, but it does not contain a
time of submission. Instead of reading from the CD-ROM drive, you can
also specify an album with --discid or --albumid. If a list of track
numbers is also specified, only those tracks will be printed.

If you are really lazy and don't want to put the CD in, you can use
mbfind, specify the album name with --album, and choose the album's MBID
from that. (You can also try specifying --artist, but at the moment it
does not really work and cannot be used in combination with --album.)

Ripping CDs
===========

peel, the CD ripper, reads a description of tracks to rip from standard
input, invokes cdparanoia to read from the CD, then sends the audio to
standard output, while also writing out encoded files (sort of like the
unix "tee" command). Thus, here's the trivial case of ripping a CD:

    $ mbget | peel | funnel | play -q -t raw -c 2 -r 44100 -s -b 16 -

The "funnel" command (included in this package) serves to buffer data so
that the audio does not drop out if cdparanoia stalls. "play" is part of
sox.

As this is a lot of typing, there is an interactive wrapper shell
script, unpeel, that will run mbget, give you the opportunity to correct
or enter the data for your CD, then run the rest of the pipeline for
you. You can change the command used to play audio with the environment
variable UNPEEL_PLAY. On Linux systems, "aplay -q -t raw -c 2 -r 44100
-f S16_LE" may be handy.

peel can also rip and encode without outputting any audio, by specifying
the -q option; this will generally be CPU-bound, as the encoder no
longer has to wait for the sound card. If you have sox installed, it can
also rip from already-extracted WAV files, as produced by cdparanoia -B,
with the -c option; here, extraction will be IO-bound, so you can remove
the CD as quickly as possible. You can of course start peel -c while
cdparanoia -B is running, but I would recommend against using -q in this
case.

There are currently two encoders defined, oggenc and lame, and one
ripper, cdparanoia. You can set which one to use and their options in
~/.peelrc, which is a standard Python-style configuration file:

    [commands]
    rip = cdparanoia
    encode = oggenc

    [options]
    cdparanoia = -X
    oggenc = -q 5
    lame = --preset standard

(I do not endorse the use of lame or any other MP3 encoder, but I'm not
about to prevent you from using it.) I would love definitions for other
rippers or encoders out there.

The paths for encoded files are generated with Python-style string
interpolation:

    [output]
    path = %(artist)s/%(album)s/%(number)02d. %(artist)s - %(title)s

The keys available depend only on the input given to peel. I may or may
not consider using something like empy here.

N.b.: funnel can be replaced with bfr, a general-purpose pipe-buffering
program with extensive options for tuning the buffer size and other
parameters. It includes a "bfp" command which can take the place of both
funnel and play (including all the audio format options, as it defaults
to CD audio settings) in the pipeline, although it is limited to OSS
output.

Replaying tracks from a CD
==========================

lastcd will take a list of songs encoded in this format, add submission
times to them as if they had all just been played in order, and write
them to lastfmsubmitd's spool or stdout.
