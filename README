This is a collection of programs that originally accumulated within my
"lastfmsubmitd" package. They gather data from MusicBrainz and use it to
rip CDs and/or submit to Last.fm.

Querying
========

mbget will read the CD in your computer's CD-ROM drive, query
MusicBrainz for its album information, and output it in YAML. This
format is like the one lastfmsubmitd uses, but it does not contain the
time of submission. Instead of reading from the CD-ROM drive, you can
also specify an album with --discid or --albumid. If a list of track
numbers is also specified, only those tracks will be printed.

If you are really lazy and don't want to put the CD in, you can use
mbfind, specify the album name with --album, and choose the album's MBID
from that. (You can also try specifying --artist, but at the moment it
does not really work and cannot be used in combination with --album.)

Ripping CDs
===========

peel, the CD ripper, reads a description of tracks to rip from standard
input. So, here's the trivial case of ripping a CD:

    $ mbget | peel

Replaying tracks from a CD
==========================

lastcd will take a list of songs encoded in this format, add submission
times to them as if they had all just been played in order, and write
them to lastfmsubmitd's spool or stdout.
